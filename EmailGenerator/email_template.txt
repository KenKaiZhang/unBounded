Hi [store],

My name is Ken Zhang, and I am currently working on a new e-commerce website that I believe your brand’s values and products would be a great fit for.

The project is called unBounded and the goal of this website is to introduce international fashion brands to the United States where I am currently based. Unique fashion such as the ones from [store] are hard to come by due to limited options or untrustworthy websites or brands. unBounded’s goal is to alleviate those problems and provide a platform for people to explore and purchase unique fashion from a trustworthy source.

The partnership will entail the promotion, sponsorship, and potential distribution of your products through unBounded’s web presence. All we have to do is figure out the best method for me to get my hands on your products so unBounded can host them for you. I believe this partnership will be highly valuable to [store] since unBounded will allow you guys to reach farther targeted audiences or even bring in new ones.

Although unBounded’s web presence is still fairly new and does not have a significant following yet, I strongly believe in our goal in spreading culture through unique fashion and with [store] being a part of this journey, I am confident that we will achieve this goal.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this email and for your consideration. Feel free to reach out if you guys have any questions or want to discuss anything more.

Thank you for your consideration,
Ken Zhang
